## usage

The fastest way to get started with Compute@Edge is though [Fastly CLI](https://github.com/fastly/cli#installation)

```sh
$ fastly compute build
```

To start fasttime, just provide it with the path to your Fastly Compute@Edge `.wasm` build artifact.

```sh
$ fasttime -w path/to/main.wasm
```

This starts up a localhost HTTP server listening on port `3000` which you can interact with with
an HTTP client like `curl`

```sh
curl -i "http://localhost:3000"
```

### backends

A common usecase for Fastly is proxying a set backend hosts referred to by name. `fasttime` supports
providing multiple `-b | --backend` flags with values of the form `{backend}:{host}`. By default if you
send a request to a backend that you have not mapped, a bad gateway response will be returned by the server.

```sh
$ fasttime -w path/to/main.wasm \
    -b backend-two:localhost:3001 \
    -b backend-two:you.com
```

### debugging

Set the `RUST_LOG` env variable to `fastime=debug` and run as usual

```
RUST_LOG=fasttime=debug fasttime -w path/to/main.wasm
```
